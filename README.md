# AAI695_Project
There are two mains in this code: main.py and main.ipynb. Use main.ipynb for Anaconda environments. 

When working in the git, do not add the .tif or .png files as it will make the repo bloated. These will be added at the very end before submission. The 100p and 200p prefixes refer to the window sizes (100x100 pixels, 200x200 pixels) used. All pixels will be added as a .csv file later.
